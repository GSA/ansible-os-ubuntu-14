Ansible Roles for Ubuntu 14

# To Do

1. Update IDs and Groups to match updated guide [GSA Ubuntu 14](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mrYIgaN1941K3HbvIAYGQhHLfpZ3T70rM4UTzzb6vOM/edit#gid=248990558) Also should probably reflect SCORED/UNSCORED tags
2. Its clear this was poached from [here](https://github.com/awailly/cis-ubuntu-ansible). There are still references to the original developers and such in here. This all needs to be cleaned up and sanitized for the GSA. I'm all for giving credit where credit is due but we don't need personal gmail contact info in here.
3. Test and determine the gaps!
